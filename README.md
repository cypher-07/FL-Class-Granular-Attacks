# FL-Class-Granular-Attacks
Implements a stealthy class-targeted model poisoning attack in federated learning that degrades a chosen class while preserving overall accuracy, bypassing prior defenses under heterogeneous data. Includes a lightweight proxy-data ensemble distillation defense that restores accuracy without labels or attacker detection.
